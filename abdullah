Summary: This program inputs employee names and salaries, calculates the average salary,
         and identifies employees with salaries within 5,000 of the average.
Variables:
    names (list of str): Stores employee names
    salaries (list of float): Stores employee salaries in thousands
    sentinel (str): Sentinel value to end input ("END")
    salary (float): Temporary variable for salary input
    total_salary (float): Sum of all salaries
    average_salary (float): Average of all salaries
